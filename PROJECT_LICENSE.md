8. Third-Party Licenses

This License applies only to components authored by the Licensor.

Some parts of the Software may depend on external libraries (e.g., JOGL). Those remain under their own terms. This License does not override them. Where a conflict exists, the third-party license governs for that portion.

The Licensor‚Äôs moral rights, as recognized by the French Intellectual Property Code, remain reserved.

12. Quick Summary (Non-Binding)

 Free for individuals, students, educators, artists, and small creators (< $100k/year).
